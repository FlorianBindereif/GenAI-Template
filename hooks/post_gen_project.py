Next steps:
1. Navigate into your new project directory:
{cd_command}

2. (Optional) Use your IDE to 'Reopen in Container' to use the devcontainer.
   The container will set up the virtual environment and install dependencies automatically.

3. If not using a Dev Container, set up your environment and install dependencies manually:
{sync_command}
{precommit_command}

4. Happy Hacking!
